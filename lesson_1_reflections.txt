Ques:What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
this helps in going back to any version of the file and allows more flexibility in editing the file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log works simply and displays git id with message and time. the commits are printed in descending order.
git diff first_id second_id shows the difference in two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
as we can go to previous working version whenever we cause a disaster.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
